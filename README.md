# Python Bulk Image Compressor + Resizer

## Overview
The Python Bulk Image Compressor + Resizer is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of compressing and resizing images in bulk. This tool is designed to handle large batches of images efficiently, while allowing you to control various aspects of the compression process, such as quality, output format, and metadata preservation.

### Features
- **Ease of Use:** Intuitive CLI commands for fast and simple operations.
- **Customizable:** Configure options like image quality, format, maximum width, and metadata handling.
- **Metadata Management:** Preserve or strip EXIF data such as GPS location, camera settings, and timestamps.
- **Supported Formats:** Wide compatibility with popular image formats, including advanced formats like AVIF and HEIF.
- **Performance:** Built-in multithreading for faster processing of large image batches.
- **Logs:** Comprehensive logging for operation tracking, configurable via `configurations.ini`.
- **Extensibility:** Future-ready for GUI development and cloud integration.

| **-r**  | No       | `no`            | Remove larger files   | If set to `y`, deletes compressed images if they are larger than the original.                                                            | `-r y`                      |

### Logging

- A `logs.txt` file is created/appended in the script's directory.
- Maximum rows are configured in `[logs] max_rows`. Older entries are pruned when the limit is exceeded.
- Log levels:
  - `log_success`
  - `log_errors`
  - `log_warnings`
- Enable or disable logging levels in `configurations.ini`.

---

### Examples

```bash
python main.py -l "D:/Images/Originals/" -d "D:/Images/Compressed/" -f webp -w 500 -q 80 -rm y
```

Example output:

   ```bash
   python main.py -l "C:/Your Folder/"
   ```
   Defaults: JPEG format, 80% quality, 1920px max width, `/data/output/` as the destination folder.
2. Simplified the code using `*args` and `**kwargs`.

#### **05/12/2022**

    > ![terminal](https://github.com/georgekhananaev/py-image-compressor/blob/main/screenshots/multicore.gif?raw=true)
2. Enhanced terminal output for better visualization of size savings.
3. Began GUI development for Windows and Ubuntu.
4. Added `-r y` to skip retaining larger compressed images.

---

### Future Plans
- A GUI interface will be added if this project receives 50+ stars on GitHub.
- Integration with cloud storage services like AWS S3 and Google Drive for automatic uploads.
- Support for more advanced image editing options, such as cropping and watermarking.

> **Personal Note:** I use this script for compressing images for React-based websites and converting entire folders to WebP format with a single command.
