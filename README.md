# Python Bulk Image Compressor + Resizer

This Python script allows you to compress and resize images in bulk. It can optionally preserve EXIF metadata and file timestamps or remove them entirely if the `-rm y` flag is used.

### Features
- **Supports Multiple Formats:**
  - **Full Metadata Preservation:** JPEG, JPG, TIFF.
  - **Partial/No Metadata:** PNG, WEBP, BMP, etc., do not reliably store EXIF data.
- **Metadata Removal:** If `-rm y` is specified, all metadata (e.g., GPS, date/time, camera info) is stripped, and timestamps are reset instead of being copied from the source.
- **Logging:** Logs each compression operation in a `logs.txt` file. You can configure the maximum row limit for the log file in the `[logs]` section of `configurations.ini`. When the log file exceeds this limit, older rows are removed.

### Usage

| Command | Required | Default Value   | Description           | Details                                                                                                                                   | Example                      |

| **-l**  | Yes      | N/A             | Input location        | Path to the folder containing original images.                                                                                            | `-l "C:/Original Images/"` |
| **-d**  | No       | `/data/output/` | Output location       | Path where compressed images will be saved.                                                                                              | `-d "C:/Compressed Images/"` |
| **-w**  | No       | `1920`          | Max width             | Resize images to this maximum width while maintaining aspect ratio.                                                                       | `-w 1920`                   |
| **-q**  | No       | `80`            | Quality               | Image quality (percentage). Lower values save more space.                                                                                 | `-q 80`                     |

| **-r**  | No       | `no`            | Remove larger files   | If set to `y`, deletes compressed images if they are larger than the original.                                                            | `-r y`                      |
| **-rm** | No       | `no`            | Remove metadata       | If set to `y`, removes all metadata (EXIF, GPS, etc.) and resets timestamps.                                                              | `-rm y`                     |
| **-h**  | No       | -               | Help                  | Displays help information about commands.                                                                                                | `-h` or `--help`            |

> **Note:** Use quotation marks for paths with spaces (e.g., `"C:/My Folder/"`).

### Logging

- A `logs.txt` file is created/appended in the script's directory.
- Maximum rows are configured in `[logs] max_rows`. Older entries are pruned when the limit is exceeded.
- Log levels:
  - `log_success`
  - `log_errors`
  - `log_warnings`
- Enable or disable logging levels in `configurations.ini`.

---

### Examples

```bash
python main.py -l "D:/Images/Originals/" -d "D:/Images/Compressed/" -f webp -w 500 -q 80 -rm y
```

Example output:

    > ![terminal](https://github.com/georgekhananaev/py-image-compressor/blob/main/screenshots/multicore.gif?raw=true)
2. Enhanced terminal output for better visualization of size savings.

---

### Future Plans
- A GUI interface will be added if this project receives 50+ stars on GitHub.
- Integration with cloud storage services like AWS S3 and Google Drive for automatic uploads.
- Support for more advanced image editing options, such as cropping and watermarking.

> **Personal Note:** I use this script for compressing images for React-based websites and converting entire folders to WebP format with a single command.
